// This proto file is used to define shared, immutable enums used externally and internally.
//
// By declaring them in this common package, we're able to simplify our SDKs by stripping
// the package name while avoiding variable name conflicts. Reducing the duplication means we
// don't need to worry about incorrectly casting between enum types, but does mean there is a
// greater potential for leaking information.
//
// These enums can have variants appended to them, but names cannot be changed without proper
// planning as they could cause API breaking changes as well as other potential downstream impacts.
